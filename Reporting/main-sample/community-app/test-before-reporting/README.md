# Test before Reporting

This Maven project contains a simple test before including the Reporting components.

The Appium code sample includes installing the Perfecto Community native app on an Android device (from the Lab repository), navigating within the app, closing and uninstalling the app.

Before running, make sure to:
- update the Lab credentials in the test
- register to the Perfecto community (community.perfectomobile.com)
- update the community credentials in the test
